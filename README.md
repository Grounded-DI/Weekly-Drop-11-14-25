# Grounded DI's Weekly-Drop-11-14-25

Grounded DI — System Hardening Release

This drop documents the internal hardening architecture of Deterministic Intelligence (DI), including the full scroll-governed runtime pipeline, entropy-bounded decision layer, and multi-lock stability mechanisms that underpin DI².

The diagrams in this release form the first complete public map of:
	•	How DI² maintains deterministic behavior
	•	How drift is detected, isolated, and prevented
	•	How scroll governance shapes runtime outputs
	•	How VaultSeal + Gatekeeper + FastPath form a stable operating system
	•	How domain applications (BriefWise, StormWise, HazardWise, etc.) sit atop the substrate

This release is engineered for transparency, not marketing.
It is a technical artifact for researchers, policymakers, and engineers who want to understand how deterministic AI can remain stable, auditable, and drift-free.

🆕 Highlights in This Drop

System Hardening Components Added
	•	Entropy Field Graph — visualizes ΔH 0.0042 → harmonic stabilization → noise floor.
	•	Runtime Hardening Map — outlines scroll-hardened, reflex-hardened, causally-hardened layers.
	•	System Locks Graph — shows ScrollLock, CausalLock, LogicTree integrity, and source audit flow.
	•	Complete DI² Architecture Map — request → FastPath → DI² engine → reflex → final output.
	•	Drift Index Topology — ΔH measurement → stability check → approved response.
	•	VaultSeal Chain — workspace → audit log → Tier-4 → immutable archive.
	•	Scroll Governance Topology — Scrolls 91 / 106 / 137 / 155 feeding runtime policy.
	•	Domain Stack Diagram — BriefWise, StormWise, VerdictBridge, HazardWise, etc. mapped over DI.

New Artifact
	•	Substack Article #1: Protocol A → DI² (in repo as Markdown)

🔧 Purpose of This Release

This weekly drop establishes a transparent, auditable record of the mechanisms that allow DI² to operate with:
	•	Deterministic inference
	•	Live drift detection
	•	Scroll-bounded logic
	•	Causal chain integrity
	•	Zero silent mutation
	•	Verifiable entropy ceilings

These artifacts collectively demonstrate that deterministic AI can operate more like a logic engine and less like a probabilistic text generator — enabling reliable usage in:
	•	Legal reasoning
	•	Severe weather prediction
	•	Hazard detection
	•	Medical triage
	•	Governance and policy
	•	Scientific analysis

This repository is part of Grounded DI’s public transparency initiative.
